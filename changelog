Changelog Roomopolis

//Structure templates should have "doors" facing north if inside the structure for correct rotations to apply

2.1.0
Added Creative Tab
Added Auto Updating
Tweaked Main class file to follow bbl standards

2.0.1
Changed ItemBuilder to
(Properties properties, String templateId, int heightAdjustment)
by default keys created like this need no key block to be placed
Added 2nd ItemBuilder
(Properties properties, String templateId, int heightAdjustment, String keyBlock)
4th parameter is the string name of the block that is required to be placed to use the key, can be any block eg "minecraft:stone"
Added 3rd ItemBuilder
(String templateId, int heightAdjustment)
Simply creates a key item that creates a structure with height adjustment
Resource Location for the templateId is now parsed in the ItemBuilder, you just need to pass the string now eg "roomopolis:tiny_room"

Tweaked translations to be more clear with the block requirements

Added proper kubejs support
```js
StartupEvents.registry('item', event => {
    //Create a custom key item like this
    event.create("test_key", 'roomopolis_key')
        //String location of the template you want to spawn example file is found here data/roomopolis/structures/tiny_room.nbt
        .templateId("roomopolis:tiny_room")
        //The structure is always placed a block behind the block you click on as the player, the height adjustment allows you to adjust the height postion the template is spawned
        .heightAdjustment(1)
        //keyBlock is optional and not needed, if a block is defined here keys will only work on that block
        .keyBlock("minecraft:iron_block")
})
```

2.0.0
Updated to minecraft 1.21.1
Basically a full rewrite of the mod
Firstly we now use structure files instead of hard coded rooms inside the mod
This allows for easier room creation and more customization
Rooms can be created in game and exported using structure blocks
Room sizes is now 48x48x48
Room keys can either require a key block to be used or not
Room keys only place if the area its placing into is clear
Custom keys should be able to be create with kubjes
Height placement is controlled by the key item in the item builder to allow better placements of templates

Using The KeyItem Class
```js
console.info('Hello, World! (Loaded startup example script)')

const ItemProperties = Java.loadClass("net.minecraft.world.item.Item$Properties");
const ResourceLocation = Java.loadClass("net.minecraft.resources.ResourceLocation");
const $keyItem = Java.loadClass('com.benbenlaw.roomopolis.item.KeyItem')

StartupEvents.registry('item', event => {
    event.createCustom("tes1s", () => new $keyItem(new ItemProperties(), ResourceLocation.parse("roomopolis:tiny_room"), 0, true));
})
```

Comes with 4 room items tiny, small, medium, large
If creating rooms that come off other rooms place a "door" shape in the structure facing north (if inside the structure) for correct rotations to apply
Room that require a key block will remove the key block and the block below to "link" the rooms together

1.0.4

Actually fixed the short room key placing block below the allow height

1.0.2

Added 14x9 wall key remover
Fixed lang files for some keys showing the wrong information
Keys now show a warning of block removal when the key is held over a room block in the world!

1.0.1

Fixed room key block remover not working in some cases
    - Smart replacing checks if the 4 blocks adjacent to the room key block are the same block and then replaces the key block with that block

1.0.0

Added roomopolis to BBL mods
